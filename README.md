## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Copy your config and replace values in `src/firebase.js`

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Features

### Authentication Flow
- Landing page redirects to Login
- Users can sign up or login with email/password
- Successful authentication redirects to Home dashboard

### Dashboard
- Clean, professional design with 4 main feature cards
- Each feature has its own dedicated page
- Consistent color scheme throughout

### Future Development
Each page is structured as a placeholder ready for feature implementation:
- Timetable integration with calendar APIs
- Interactive campus maps
- News feed with college API integration  
- AI quiz generation using PDF parsing and LLM APIs

## Firebase Configuration

Replace the placeholder values in `src/firebase.js`:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com", 
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

## Team Collaboration

The project structure is designed for team development:
- Each page is a separate component for parallel development
- Consistent styling through CSS custom properties
- Clear separation of concerns between auth, routing, and features
- Firebase provides real-time collaboration capabilities
